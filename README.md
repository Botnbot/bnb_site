# BotnBot site

The bnb_site is the main repository for the Ghitub pages site.

It will also contain documentation for the architecture of the 3 components of the Botnbot application :
* [BotnBot App](https://github.com/frocher/bnb_app) : the Single Page Application written with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) components.
* [BotnBot Nexus](https://github.com/frocher/bnb_nexus) : the API and the core of the application.
* [BotnBot Probe](https://github.com/frocher/bnb_probe) : you can use as many probes as you want to measure your pages performance.
